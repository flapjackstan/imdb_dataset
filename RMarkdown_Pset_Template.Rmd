## Question 1 (These are headings, note the '#')
This is text. I can write text just like this and it will come out as a paragraph. 

If I want to do a bulleted list 

* I 
* can 
* do 
* one
* quite 
* easily 
    + sub-bullets are cool too

1. Numbered lists are easy too

2. Just add numbers!

   a) letters are cool too.


## 2. An introduction to code snippets. 

Adding code to your document is done using these code "chunks". Code chunks look like the code below, they start with "```" and end with "```". After the first "```" you must specify the code language to use (in this case "r").  The code will be executed and outputted when you output your document. 

You can have rich text in your documents such as *italics* by encasing the italicised word in one "*". **Bold** works the same but has two "**"s. 

```{r}
setwd('C:/Users/Elmer/Documents/R/Statistical Modeling/PSET1')
library(ISLR)
data(Auto)
plot(cars)
```

## Question 3

You can put in any type of code in your code chunk. You can execute lines of code by highlighting your cursor in the code chunk and executing it line by line using CTRL + RETURN (or COMMAND + RETURN on Macs) as you would in the editor. 

```{r}
names(Auto)
mod1 <- lm(mpg ~ weight + year + horsepower, data = Auto)
summary(mod1)

```

## Question 4

When you are done with your RMarkdown file, you can create an output file by clicking the button "Knit" above. You have three output options, HTML, PDF, and Word. Word output is fine. If you want to produce PDF files you need to first [install Miktex](https://miktex.org/download) a popular Latex framework. (Latex is a mathematical programming language.) 

![Oh yea, this is how you include images. This is the image caption](images/rmarkdown.png)

## Advanced stuff

Some more tutorials are recommended if you really want to produce cool documents:

You can do $latex$ math by using "$" as in $Y = X\beta + \epsilon$
